Sources for the Twitch.tv app project I wrote for [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com). 
The final product is available [here](https://sroelants.github.io/Twitch). 

The app shows a list of channels that you are following. Channels that are currently streaming are indicated and show extra information on the stream. Online and offline channels (streaming and not-streaming) can be filtered for, and there is a live-search functionality at the top.

The goal of the project was to get some hands-on experience with interacting with REST API's, as well as getting used to the asynchronous nature of API calls. Took it upon myself to learn using SASS, ES2015 (using Babel), and Gulp as a build tool.

Project written in: HTML5, SASS, ES2015. Using jQuery.
