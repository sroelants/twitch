# twitch_dev
Sources for the Twitch.tv app project I wrote for [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.org). 
The final product is available [here](https://sroelants.github.io/Twitch). 

The goal of the project was to get some hands-on experience with interacting with REST API's, as well as getting used to the asynchronous nature of API calls. Took it upon myself to learn using SASS, ES2015 (using Babel), and Gulp as a build tool.

Project written in: HTML5, SASS, ES2015.
